- Dependencies:
    - Python 3.8.3
    - pip 19.2.3
    - Flask 2.3.2
    - MySQL
- Steps
    - Once you get a perosnal database up and running and you make sure that the connections at the top of app.py match your specified db, then run our db_setup.sql to fill it with all the appropriate tables, and then run the Sample_Popluate.sql in order to fill the database with adaquate sample data. 
    - run the command 'Flask Run'
    - Pray it doesn't break...
