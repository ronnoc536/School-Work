# Programming assignment 4 (pa04) mnk_business

Video introduction: https://vimeo.com/485271359

You've heard of Tic-Tac-Toe, the game in which players compete to match 3 symbols on a 3x3 board.

Perhaps you've also heard of Gomoku, a similar game to match 5 symbols, played on a 15x15 board.

Perhaps you've even heard of the more obscure tiiiic-taaaaac-toe (requiring a 6x7 board), an impressive feat considering I just made it up!

You may wonder, can't this classic game be played on a 23x57 board, or a 3748573x4747593 board, or sillier still? You're mad ... but correct!

Writing an "AI" program to play this game can't be that hard, right? 
Even inanimate matchboxes can play this game!

For this assignment, you'll be creating a program that lets you play any size M,n,k game.

1. Start by reading and understanding this page, [mnk](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mmk): 
   https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter10.html

2. Read the tic-tac-toe section, and trace the tic-tac-toe code from the link below in pudb3 or spyder3!
   https://taylor.git-pages.mst.edu/index_files/Classes/CompProblemSolving/Content/11-Strings.html
   Make sure you understand it before you continue, mnk.

3. Read: 
   https://xkcd.com/832/ 
   You don't need to understand this one, mnk.

4. Read this page, mnk: 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game

5. Now, time to extend it! We give you the framework for an Mnk program, you finish the rest.

6. Have fun monkeying around with the code, mnk ;)

Note: I'm giving you the type-hinting this time (you just have to fix main's None to get the points).
