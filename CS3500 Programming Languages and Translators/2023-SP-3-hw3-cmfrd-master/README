Homework #3

IMPORTANT:

1)
Remember to follow the naming convention as described 
in the assignment document. 

2)
Modify the sample '.gitignore' file to ignore any binary files.
It is bad practice to include executables in your git repo.

3)
Remember to add, commit, and push your submission files.

	git add FILENAME
	git commit -m "meaningful commit message"
	git push
